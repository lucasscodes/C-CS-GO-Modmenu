- I learn hacking with a premade entrypoint 
- [Premade code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhjco4JbmrE)
- [Hazedumper](https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper) used to dump a fresh csgo.hpp
- Code was not ready to run, understood+debugged it and started to add new things.
# Dont even try to hack the game, this is only for learning purposes and completly ignoring VAC!
