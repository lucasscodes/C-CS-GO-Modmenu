- I learn hacking with a premade entrypoint 
- Premade code from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhjco4JbmrE
- Hazedumper on git used to dump csgo.hpp on my own
- Code was not ready to run, debugged it and started to improve it
# Dont even try to hack the game, this is only for learning purposes and completly ignoring VAC!
